# divisor_deep_dive

This repo manages the LaTeX code and reference documents in Cypher Stack reviews of Eagen's approach to divisors and subsequent work on the topic written by Alp Bassa at Veridise.
 1. Cypher Stack's first review can be found in [pdfs/sum_of_points.pdf](https://github.com/cypherstack/divisor_deep_dive/blob/main/pdfs/sum_of_points.pdf) whose LaTeX code can be found in [latex/sum_of_points/main.tex](https://github.com/cypherstack/divisor_deep_dive/blob/main/latex/sum_of_points/main.tex).
 2. Cypher Stack's follow-up can be found in [pdfs/follow_up.pdf](https://github.com/cypherstack/divisor_deep_dive/blob/main/pdfs/follow_up.pdf) whose LaTeX code can be found in [latex/follow_up/main.tex](https://github.com/cypherstack/divisor_deep_dive/blob/main/latex/follow_up/main.tex).
3. Cypher Stack's SLVer Bullet, establishing divisors on strong footing, can be found in [pdfs/silverbullet.pdf](https://github.com/cypherstack/divisor_deep_dive/blob/main/pdfs/silverbullet.pdf) whose LaTeX code can be found in [latex/silverbullet/main.tex](https://github.com/cypherstack/divisor_deep_dive/blob/main/latex/silverbullet/main.tex).
