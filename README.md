# divisor_deep_dive

This repo manages the LaTeX code and reference documents in Cypher Stack reviews, this repo manages our results from reviewing Eagen's divisors and subsequent work.
 1. Eagen published ["Zero Knowledge Proofs of Elliptic Curve Inner Products from Principal Divisors and Weil Reciprocity"](https://eprint.iacr.org/2022/596) (also in /ref_docs).
 2. To clarify the soundness proof of Eagen's work, Veridise posted [this clarifying document](https://github.com/cypherstack/divisor_deep_dive/blob/main/ref_docs/veridise_divisor_proofs.pdf).
 3. Cypher Stack adds further clarification in [latex/sum_of_points/sum_of_points.pdf](https://github.com/cypherstack/divisor_deep_dive/blob/main/latex/sum_of_points/sum_of_points.pdf) whose LaTeX code can be found in [latex/sum_of_points/main.tex](https://github.com/cypherstack/divisor_deep_dive/blob/main/latex/sum_of_points/main.tex).

Further content is forthcoming.
